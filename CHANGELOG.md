# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill library are documented here. Individual skills may also carry their own `metadata.version` in their `SKILL.md` frontmatter for finer-grained history.

## [1.6.0]

- **Plugin restructured into a full agent team.** `plugin/agents/` now holds `marketing-director` plus ten specialists (competitive-intel-analyst, seo-geo-specialist, campaign-strategist, content-writer, social-media-specialist, email-marketer, creative-specialist, performance-marketer, localization-specialist, performance-reporter). The director dispatches by discipline and sequences a full campaign in dependency order instead of running everything at once.
- Added `localization-specialist` — target-language versions (NL/FR/DE/ES) of signed-off source content via `content-translate`, run after execution and before reporting. `content-writer` no longer calls `content-translate` directly.
- Added `creative-specialist` and the new `frontend-design` skill (design/review front-end UI in a brand's visual identity — plan/critique method from Anthropic's `frontend-design`, interface rule set adapted from vercel-labs' `web-interface-guidelines`, MIT). `chape-braspenning-brand-kit` referenced a `frontend-design` skill before one existed; it does now.
- `campaign-plan`, `competitive-brief`, and `performance-report` moved back out of `/plugin` to the repo root — they're account skills like any other and nothing about them was plugin-specific. The plugin's agents call them by bare name, unaffected.
- Wired five content skills into `content-references` instead of re-implementing its rules: `copy-editing` (dropped duplicated persuasion/lexical tables and four dead skill links, kept the Seven Sweeps process), `customer-story-writer` (framework definitions now cite the hub, kept its fixed structure and framework-to-section mapping), `press-release-writer` (added a humanizing pass it was missing), `newsletter-writer` (added a structural-framework step), `email-sequence-hubspot-brevo` (per-email copy now cites the hub).
- Added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the repo root so the plugin installs via `claude plugin marketplace add Jordidriesen/marketing-agent` + `/plugin install marketing-agent@marketing-agent`, with `claude plugin marketplace update` for syncing later.

## [1.3.0]

- Moved `campaign-plan`, `competitive-brief`, and `performance-report` out of the flat skill list into [`/plugin`](plugin), packaged as a proper installable Claude Code / Cowork plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, its own README/LICENSE/CONNECTORS.md). Content unchanged from the 1.2.0 versions — only the packaging moved.
- Checked `.mcp.json` specifically for credentials before publishing: contains only public, standard MCP endpoint URLs and one non-secret OAuth client ID (Slack) — clean.
- Resolved: `european-market-intelligence` and `content-translate` keep their existing third-party attribution (ID8Labs skill merge, and an unnamed third-party translate module respectively) rather than being reattributed solely to Jordi — content in both is independently written beyond shared use of standard frameworks, but the attribution stays as documentation of that transformation. See the Attribution note above the skill tables.

## [1.2.0]

- Adopted cleaner, fully-generic anonymization and a frontmatter bug fix from a newer export across 8 skills (`competitive-landscape`, `competitor-analysis`, `content-references`, `content-research-orchestrator`, `content-translate`, `european-market-intelligence`, `seo-audit`, `web-content-pipeline`).
- Added 8 new skills: `campaign-plan`, `competitive-brief`, `performance-report` (built specifically for the marketing plugin; brand-kit check added, reference tables split out, house style applied) and `brand-review`, `content-creation`, `newsletter-writer`, `press-release-writer`, `social-content-writer` (started from Anthropic's marketing plugin, substantially reworked, added as-is). See the Attribution note above the skill tables. 49 skills total.

## [1.1.0]

- Removed the four personal/lifestyle skills (`middle-eastern-fragrance-explorer`, `personal-brand-reviews`, `supermarkt-prijsanalyse`, `weekmenu-planner`) — out of scope for this repo's marketing/SEO/PPC focus. 41 skills remain.

## [1.0.0] — Initial public release

- 45 skills published across Google Ads/PPC, SEO & content research, content writing/editing, shared infrastructure, and personal-use categories.
- Client-specific brand kits (`primion-brand-kit`, `personal-brand-kit`) kept private; a small number of skills reference a generic `acme-brand-kit` placeholder as a stand-in for the `[brand]-brand-kit` pattern.
- Client name mentions anonymised throughout (`Client A`, `Client B`).
- `personal-brand-reviews` retained as the current name; the superseded `jordi-blog-reviews` (identical, pre-rename) was not carried over.
